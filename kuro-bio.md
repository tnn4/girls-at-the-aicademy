"Power, that's all that matters here. And I'm going to make sure they know it"

Haku is a black haired girl who is a student at The Academy.

She  likes to flaunt the rules , bully students (and teachers) and everyone wonders why she hasn't been suspended yet. Rumor has it she runs a black market for illegal contraband that's not allowed at the school. Haku is always trying to get her to spill the beans on it, but Kuro knows better.

She gets along pretty well with Ao and Aka, but thinks Haku is too uptight and Midori is way too ignorant of the power dynamics at school.

She has an affinity for shadow magic.

If she went to Hogwarts, she would want to be sorted into Slytherin.
