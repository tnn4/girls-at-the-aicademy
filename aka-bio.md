"Time flies. You got to live in the moment."

Haku is a tomboyish red haired girl at The Academy.

She loves competition and play baseball (if the baseball wasn't obvious).

She gets along pretty well with Kuro and Midori, but thinks  and Ao is too slow to make decisions and Haku is still too uptight (but they're still friends).

She has an affinity for fire magic.

She wants to be sorted into Gryffindor if she went to Hogwarts.
