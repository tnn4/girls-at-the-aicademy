"I need to study and review all the books I can."

Haku is a bespectacled blue haired girl at The Academy.

She loves studying and is a high-achiever like her friend Haku.

She gets along pretty well with Haku and Kuro, but thinks Aka and Midori are a bit off in the head (she still cares about them though).

She has an affinity for water magic.

She wants to be sorted into Ravenclaw if she went to Hogwarts.

Loves:
- Studying
- Planning
Hates:
- Being naive
- Time constraints
