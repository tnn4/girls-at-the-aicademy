## Each girl has her own hobbies and preferences.

![haku](assets/Image_fx(143).jpeg)
Haku's the Vice President and Accountant of her year's class. She loves to stay organized. She just can't stand disorganization and gets stressed out trying to keep things in order.

"Damn it, we've lost the club leaders and funding for so many clubs. It's all a mess. I'm going to have to up the fundraisers."

---

![ao](assets/Image_fx(100).jpeg)
Ao wants to do something academic one day so loves to hit the books and study in her free time.

"Hmm, for every action there is an equal an opposite reaction..."

---

![kuro](assets/Image_fx(109).jpeg)

Kuro loves to do things her way so she loves to bully and assert her authority whenever she can.

"Do you have any idea how much lunch money you owe me?"

"I'm sorry Kuro-sama! I forgot!"

---

Aka loves sports and the thrill and competition of baseball.

"Take that! You losers!"

Midori loves the peace of gardening in the school's greenhouse.

"As long as the plants are growing good and strong, I'm happy!"

They're friends but they don't always get along.

Haku, the class Vice President, angry at Kuro for bulling everyone she comes across and telling her she's going to give the Academy a bad rep.

"Kuro, you can't be bullying everyone you come across."

"He owed me _soooo_ much lunch money."

"NO ONE OWES YOU LUNCH MONEY!!"

"Says you."

"Don't go messing with my books Aka!!"

"OWWW!"

![ur-conflict](assets/Image_fx(231).jpeg)

"You stay away from that flower Kuro."

"I wasn't going to step on it. Promise!"

---

## But when the going gets tough, they really do love each other.

"Come on Ao-chan, an A- on the test can't be that bad!"

"I'm a FAILURE!"

---

![ub-icecream](assets/Image_fx(91).jpeg)
"Cheer up Aka-chan, we'll get you a new one."

"WAAAAAH."

"Oh, this isn't about the ice cream is it?"

"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH. They gave me the wrong flavor!"


---

![ub-cheer](assets/Image_fx(85).jpeg)
"Come on Aka-chan. Losing the regionals can't be that bad."

"WAAAAAAAAAAH."

Kuro: *crying*

"I told you this is what would happen if you go picking up fights with everybody. You can't win them all."

"I know."

They not only have to deal with getting good grades. They also have to deal with fighting evil monsters!
