"Let the plants grow big and strong and lets all get along!"

Haku is a green haired girl who is a student at The Academy.

She is known for her exceptional kindness and loves to volunteer at the school's greenhouse raising and nurturing the plants (and her friends). A lot of people think she's ignorant and has her head in the clouds but they all love her regardless.

She gets along pretty well with Haku and Aka, but thinks Kuro is too power hungry and that Ao can be too logical sometimes when she should be going with her guts and instincts more often.

She has an affinity for nature magic. 

If she went to Hogwarts, she would want to be sorted into Hufflepuff.
